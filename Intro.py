# open up pycharm
# 1 Read through the problem
# 2 Write down the input and ALL outputs
# 3 is it returned or printed
# 4 write down the steps of how to get from inputs to outputs 
# give all the questions ago - can get some score
# check syntax, indentation/colons, correct return/print statement

# COMMENTS
# write down comments especially when you dont know what you are doing - show logic 'my next step would be'


# TESTING
# Test examples given and outliers - smallers and largest, some in middle, negative or positive

# REFACTORING
# simple code then clean up after
# meaningful variables - understore  e.g multiples_of_three
# loops and if statments where possible
# try use += assignment operator












#CLEAN CODE Check list
# iterate with enumerate (returns both index and value from the list )instead of range(Len())
#  for index, name in eneumerate(names):                    - you can pass in start=1 in brackets
#    print (index,name)
#list comprehention instead of raw for loops
# built in sorted function to build list eg sorted_data = storted(data) in asedning order or desedning (data, reverse=true)
# the result will be a list

# complex iterable such as list and inside list a dict, sort list accoring to element category
# storted(data,key=lamda x: x ["age"])

#Store unique values, with sets - a set is an unordered type with no duplicates eg set(my_list)



# getter & setter
#setattr(person.first)
