# Looping over lists

# looping over two lists - ZIP FUNCTIONS
# For name, hero in zip(names, heroes):
#    print(f'{name} is actually {hero}

# this shows looping over two lists, using zip function, will only loop until shorted list ends - can do more than 2
# for name, hero in the lists names and heroes, print name and hero values from list togther in formatted string

# for value in zip(names,heroes,universes):
# Print(value)
# this will acess all the values/ single tuple, all first values, the all second, then all third

#different ways to UNPACK VALUES in a list

# a , b = (1, 2)
#print(a)
#print(b)

# # a , b , *c = (1, 2, 3,4,5,6)
# #print(a)
#Print(b)
#Print(c) - c will be equal to everything else
# an understore in a place of a variable name/letter will comment it out and not output/igorne it

# # a , b ,*c , d = (1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7, 8 )
# #print(a)
#Print(b)
#Print(c)
#print(d)
# this will return c as all the values just before the first one and to ignore put _
